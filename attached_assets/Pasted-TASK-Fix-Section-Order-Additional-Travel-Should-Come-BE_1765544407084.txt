TASK: Fix Section Order - Additional Travel Should Come BEFORE Return Travel

ISSUE: On the Preview & Arrange page, Additional Travel is appearing LAST, but it should come BEFORE Return Travel. Return Travel should always be the last travel-related section.

CORRECT ORDER:
1. Travel Details
2. Travellers
3. Outbound Travel
4. Accommodation
5. Activities
6. Dining
7. **Additional Travel** ← Should be here
8. **Return Travel** ← Should always be last
9. Helpful Information

FIX:

1. FIND the Preview & Arrange component where sections are rendered

2. LOCATE where sections are ordered (likely a defaultSectionOrder array or similar)

3. UPDATE the order to ensure Return Travel comes after Additional Travel:
```tsx
const defaultSectionOrder = [
  'travel-details',
  'travellers',
  'outbound-travel',
  'accommodation',
  'activities',
  'dining',
  'additional-travel',    // Position 7
  'return-travel',        // Position 8 - ALWAYS LAST
  'helpful-information',
];
```

4. IF sections are rendered in JSX order, rearrange them:
```tsx
<div>
  {/* Travel Details */}
  {/* Travellers */}
  {/* Outbound Travel */}
  
  {/* Accommodation */}
  {accommodations.map(...)}
  
  {/* Activities */}
  {activities.map(...)}
  
  {/* Dining */}
  {dining.map(...)}
  
  {/* Additional Travel - BEFORE Return Travel */}
  {additionalTravel && additionalTravel.length > 0 && (
    <section>
      <h2>Additional Travel</h2>
      {additionalTravel.map(...)}
    </section>
  )}
  
  {/* Return Travel - ALWAYS LAST */}
  {returnTravel && (
    <section>
      <h2>Return Travel</h2>
      {/* return travel content */}
    </section>
  )}
  
  {/* Helpful Information */}
</div>
```

5. IF using display_order in database, ensure Return Travel has the highest number:
```sql
-- Check current display_order values
SELECT section_name, display_order FROM itinerary_sections WHERE itinerary_id = X;

-- Update if needed
UPDATE itinerary_sections SET display_order = 7 WHERE section_name = 'additional-travel';
UPDATE itinerary_sections SET display_order = 8 WHERE section_name = 'return-travel';
```

6. MAKE SURE Return Travel is NOT draggable (if it should always stay last):
```tsx
{/* Return Travel - NO drag handle, fixed position */}
<section className="mb-8">
  <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mb-4">Return Travel</h2>
  {/* No drag handle dots here */}
  {/* Just content */}
</section>
```

7. IF Additional Travel can be dragged but should stay before Return Travel:

Add a constraint in the drag handler:
```tsx
const handleDragEnd = (event) => {
  const { active, over } = event;
  
  // Prevent dragging Additional Travel after Return Travel
  if (active.id.startsWith('additional-travel-') && over.id === 'return-travel') {
    return; // Block the drop
  }
  
  // ... rest of drag logic
};
```

LOGICAL ORDER EXPLANATION:
- Additional Travel = extra flights/trains during the trip (between activities)
- Return Travel = final journey home (always at the end)

So chronologically:
1. Arrive (Outbound)
2. Stay & explore (Accommodation, Activities, Dining)
3. Move around during trip (Additional Travel)
4. Go home (Return Travel) ← ALWAYS LAST

TEST:
1. View Preview & Arrange page
2. Additional Travel section should appear before Return Travel
3. Return Travel should be the last travel-related section
4. Order should make chronological sense
